**Skrolls** is an online note-taking and sharing app that does not require registering. 
Individual documents (or Skrolls) are accessed by their filename. Any visitor can 
view an existing Skroll by inputting its name. If such a name does not yet exist, 
it will be created. Skrolls are simple .txt documents, but with some added 
functionality for registered users: read/write permissions, password-protection and 
changelogs, to restore to previous states. The app can be used on multiple devices, 
visitors can also subscribe to individual Skrolls through RSS, share them on different 
social media and use their Google account to login instead of registering.
